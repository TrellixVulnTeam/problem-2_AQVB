### Get-me-hired-series n2

I was asked to develop a memory game. I sadly failed to get the cards to keep their aspect ratio when the window resizes...
BUT i had lots of fun exploring OOP concepts, rethought the whole app design a couple times, and learnt a lot doing it.

Thanks to ***** for giving me this task
